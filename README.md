# Overview

This project heavily relies on a fake REST API provide by json-server. click[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) to go through the official documentation and find out how to run the server and track your data.

**Note: Use 'json-server --watch data/db.json --port 7000' to run your local server**

This project is still work in progress and commits will continually be made to complete it.
